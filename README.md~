## Yelp Connector
It returns the queries specified in the `Yelper.java`, but you need to first provide the `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `TOKEN_SECRET` which Yelp provides for developers in the `Yelper.java` (maybe an interface would be much better to enter those constants).  
It uses Gson to parse data sent by Yelp.  It returns also other properties which Yelp provides like url of restaurant, phone, adress and so on.  
It could write the restaurants and categories which they serve in a query basis into a file.
